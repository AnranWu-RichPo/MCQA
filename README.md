## Overview

MCQA is a large-scale Multi-chart question answering dataset that emphasizes logical and numerical reasoning. In comparison to previous chart question answering datasets, this dataset innovatively join multiple charts for joint reasoning to uncover deeper correlations and potential viewpoints within the charts. Additionally, the questions in the MCQA dataset necessitate a certain level of ability to understand charts and strong numerical reasoning and calculation skills. The dataset comprises 22,860 generated chart pairs and 100,331 questions that that demand a high degree of reasoning ability and chart understanding.  It has been partitioned into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8:1:1.
